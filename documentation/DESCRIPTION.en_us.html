<p>Anvers is an open-source serif typeface designed for easy readability over long stretches of small text in print and on-screen. The typeface follows in the footsteps of commonly-used printers' typefaces such as Monotype's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantin_(typeface)">Plantin</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garamond">the various Garamond typefaces</a>, among many others, in its wide apertures, chunky letterforms and pursuit of readability. Anvers is currently a roman-only typeface, in regular, semibold and bold weights.</p>
